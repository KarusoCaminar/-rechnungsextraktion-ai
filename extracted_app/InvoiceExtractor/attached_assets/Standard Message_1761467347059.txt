Standard Message: 
The Rechnungs-Extraktions-System web app is working great! When you first open it, the dashboard shows everything correctly, including the four stat cards which are all at zero since there are no invoices yet. You can easily upload a new invoice or go to the history, and the sidebar can be collapsed and expanded without any issues. All the pages and buttons look good and work as expected, with consistent colors, readable text, and proper spacing.
